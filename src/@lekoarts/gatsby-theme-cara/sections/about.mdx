## About

> Im mr.x, from bd. im a ethical hacker. I love to write code and web design.

I’m a designer who codes. I'm also the author of [Islamforlife24](https://www.ifl24.com "Bangla islamic website"). I’ve worked internationally, in-house, and remotely on projects for leading brands, agencies, startups, and charities. I care deeply about creating world-class, useful, and beautiful products that help people and make a difference. I can be as involved in your project as you need me to be; from the seed of the idea, to sketches, creative direction, design, copywriting, system design, and even the front-end and WordPress build.
